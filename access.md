**We are striving to make the Big Team Science Conference as accessible as possible. Please [contact us](mailto:bigteamscienceconference@gmail.com) with any questions or comments about accessibility.** 


## Conference platform

* Primary conference platform: Zoom.
* Captions: provided by the Zoom platform
* Collaborative text editing: [Framapad](https://framapad.org/abc/en/)
  * We will be using Framapad for collaborative text editing during hackathons and other coworking sessions. While some less accessible visual co-working tools (e.g., Miro) may be used at the discretion of session chairs, the main communication will take place in the Framapad.

## Slide sharing

Following best practices in accessibility and inclusivity for all attendees, the expectation is that presenters will share a link to their presentation and materials (i.e., slides) prior to their presentation time. Links to slides will be added to the conference program. 

* [Accessibility guidelines from the useR! 2021 conference](https://user2021.r-project.org/participation/accessibility/), with lots of helpful information about creating/sharing accessible slides and making your presentation as accessible as possible.
* [Tutorial on how to use Grackle](https://teacherscollege.screenstepslive.com/a/1709744-add-grackle-to-your-google-docs-slides-or-sheets), a Google Slides extension that checks for accessibility.


## Session recordings

Sessions will be recorded and shared with conference registrants. An email will be sent to all registrants after the conference with instructions on how to access recordings.


## Note to all attendees

We aim to make this conference a welcoming, inclusive event. As an attendee, you play a very important role in this. We are a neurodiverse community, and we don’t all communicate and express ourselves the same way. Some people prefer direct, literal communication and others talk in idioms and metaphors. Some people need extra time to process and respond. Communication is a two-way process, so let’s be flexible and accommodate different communication styles. Sometimes a person may need to leave in the middle of a session, or flap their hands, or pace up and down, or go to a quiet space, and that’s ok. So if someone’s behavior seems strange to you, don’t make assumptions – talk to them directly... Raise your hand and ask the presenter to describe what’s happening in their silent video, for the benefit of those who can’t see it. These are the actions that add up to a truly inclusive event where we all feel welcome.  Let’s make this conference an amazing experience for everyone.<a id="footnote-1-ref" href="#footnote-1" title="link to footnote">[1]</a>

Notes:
- accessible conference guide: http://www.sigaccess.org/welcome-to-sigaccess/resources/accessible-conference-guide/#website
- At the start of the conference, if there are attendees in the audience with vision impairments, remind presenters that all slides, videos and visual demos will need to be described as part of the spoken presentation. Session chairs can help re-enforce this.
- Work with the proceedings publishers to ensure that the index and table of contents of the electronic proceedings are available in an accessible format. If they are html, the W3C WCAG 2.0 guidelines apply. For pdf documents, the Adobe Acrobat accessibility check applies (see resources below for more information about creating accessible pdf documents).
- Work with the proceedings chairs to ensure that accepted conference submissions are made accessible. The publishers Sheridan can also help with this if requested.
- Encourage authors to caption videos that will be released by the conference.

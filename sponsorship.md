We’re excited this year to launch our **participation support bursary** (also known as a microgrant)! We recognise that participation in online events can be challenging for people in different ways, and we’d like to remove these barriers as much as possible. 

## FAQ for BTSCon Participants:

**Q: What can I ask for?**
**A:** Generally, we offer support in the form of one or more of the following: 
- **Small hardware:** Headset, microphone, webcam, ring lighting.
- **Internet:** 1 month of high-speed internet.
- **Diesel** or other fuel for generators.
- **Childcare costs** for the duration of the event.
- **Hotel or co-working space** for the duration of the event. 

[OLS](https://we-are-ols.org) will administer the microgrants - for more information, see [OLS’s microgrant policies](https://openlifesci.org/openseeds/cohort-procedures-and-templates/microgrants.html#microgrant-recommendations-and-tips).

**Q: Will I have to justify my request, write a blog, have an accepted session, or any other obligation from requesting a bursary?**    
**A:** No :) Our goal is to make this as pain-free as possible. If you _want_ to write a blog, or submit a talk - please do so! 

**Q: I can't afford to pay for X and get reimbursed. Can I still apply?**    
**A:** Please do! We offer three ways to get microgrants/bursaries:
1. Share a purchase link and we'll ship it to your house on your behalf. 
2. Purchase an item yourself, share a receipt, and we'll reimburse you. 
3. Money up-front, if neither of the previous options work. 

**Q: Is there a $£€ limit to what I can ask for?**    
**A:** Generally no - we try not to quibble over reasonable requests, because we recognise that supply chains and fluctuating currencies make it hard to predict costs. The main exception: For a short conference, we're unable to pay for more than one month of internet or for large items like a laptop, monitor, or phone. If you go for top-of-the-line items, we might ask for you to come back with a cheaper (but still decent quality) alternative. 
  
**How to request a bursary:** Please email [bigteamscienceconference@gmail.com](mailto:bigteamscienceconference@gmail.com) with a rough budget and the items you need.
